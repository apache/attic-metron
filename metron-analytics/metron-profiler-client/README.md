# Metron Profiler Client

This project provides a client API for accessing the profiles generated by the [Metron Profiler](..//metron-profiler).  This includes both a Java API and Stellar API for accessing the profile data.  The primary use case is to extract profile data for use during model scoring.

## Stellar Client API

The following are usage examples that show how the Stellar API can be used to read profiles generated by the [Metron Profiler](../metron-profiler).  This API would be used in conjunction with other Stellar functions like [`MAAS_MODEL_APPLY`](../../metron-platform/metron-common) to perform model scoring on streaming data.

These examples assume a profile has been defined called 'snort-alerts' that tracks the number of Snort alerts associated with an IP address over time.  The profile definition might look similar to the following.

```
{
  "profiles": [
    {
      "profile": "snort-alerts",
      "foreach": "ip_src_addr",
      "onlyif":  "source.type == 'snort'",
      "update":  { "s": "STATS_ADD(s, 1)" },
      "result":  "STATS_MEAN(s)"
    }
  ]
}
```

During model scoring the entity being scored, in this case a particular IP address, will be known.  The following examples highlight how this profile data might be retrieved.

The Stellar client consists of the `PROFILE_GET` command, which takes the following arguments:
```
REQUIRED:
    profile - The name of the profile
    entity - The name of the entity
    durationAgo - How long ago should values be retrieved from?
    units - The units of 'durationAgo'
OPTIONAL:
    config_override - Optional - Map of key-value pairs, each overriding the global config parameter
            of the same name
    groups - Optional - The desired subset of the groups used to sort the profile - This is a sequence of
            as many groupBy names as desired (not a List in square brackets).
```
Note that in order to use the `groups` argument in the client, the profile must have been created with the [`groupBy`](../metron-profiler#groupby) option.

### Examples
Retrieve all values of 'snort-alerts' from '10.0.0.1' over the past 4 hours.
```
PROFILE_GET('snort-alerts', '10.0.0.1', 4, 'HOURS')
```

Retrieve all values of 'snort-alerts' from '10.0.0.1' over the past 2 days.
```
PROFILE_GET('snort-alerts', '10.0.0.1', 2, 'DAYS')
```

If the profile had been defined to group the data by weekday versus weekend, then the following example would apply:

Retrieve all values of 'snort-alerts' from '10.0.0.1' that occurred on 'weekdays' over the past month.
```
PROFILE_GET('snort-alerts', '10.0.0.1', 1, 'MONTHS', 'weekdays')
```

The client may need to use a profile configuration different from the current configuration settings.  For example, perhaps you are on a cluster shared with other analysts, and need to access a profile that was constructed 2 months ago using different period duration, while they are accessing more recent profiles constructed with the currently configured period duration.  For this situation, you may use the `config_override` argument:

Retrieve all values of 'snort-alerts' from '10.0.0.1' over the past 2 days, overriding the usual global client configuration parameters for window duration.
```
PROFILE_GET('profile1', 'entity1', 2, 'DAYS', {'profiler.client.period.duration' : '2', 'profiler.client.period.duration.units' : 'MINUTES'})
```

Retrieve all values of 'snort-alerts' from '10.0.0.1' that occurred on 'weekdays' over the past month, overriding the usual global client configuration parameters for window duration.
```
PROFILE_GET('profile1', 'entity1', 1, 'MONTHS', {'profiler.client.period.duration' : '2', 'profiler.client.period.duration.units' : 'MINUTES'}, 'weekdays')
```

### Configuration

By default, the Profiler creates Profiles with a period duration of 15 minutes. This means that data is accumulated, summarized and flushed every 15 minutes. The Client API must also have knowledge of this duration to correctly retrieve the profile data. If the client API is expecting 15 minute periods, it will not be able to read data generated by a Profiler that has been configured with a 1 hour period.

The period duration is configured in the Profiler by altering the Profiler topology's static properties file (`$METRON/config/profiler.properties`). The Stellar Client API can be configured correspondingly by setting the following properties in Metron's global configuration.  Any of these six parameters may be overridden at run time using the `config_override` Map argument.

| ------------------------------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |

| profiler.client.period.duration.units | The units used to specify the profile period duration.  This value should be defined along with `profiler.client.period.duration`. | Optional | MINUTES  |

| profiler.client.salt.divisor          | The salt divisor used to store profile data. | Optional | 1000     |
| hbase.provider.impl                   | The name of the HBaseTableProvider implementation class. | Optional |          |

## Getting Started

These instructions step through the process of using the Stellar Client API on a live cluster.  These instructions assume that the 'Getting Started' instructions included with the [Metron Profiler](../metron-profiler) have been followed.  This will create a Profile called 'test' whose data will be retrieved with the Stellar Client API.

To validate that everything is working, login to the server hosting Metron.  We will use the Stellar Shell to replicate the execution environment of Stellar running in a Storm topology, like Metron's Parser or Enrichment topology.  Replace 'node1:2181' with the URL to a Zookeeper Broker.  

```
[root@node1 0.3.0]# bin/stellar -z node1:2181
